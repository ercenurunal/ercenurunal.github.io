I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Psychology] (https://www.ozyegin.edu.tr/en/department-psychology) at Özyeğin University and the director of the [Language, Cognition and Development Lab] (https://labs.ozyegin.edu.tr/gelisim/).

I obtained my Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology at University of Delaware and completed my postdoctoral work at Radboud University and Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. 

I study the relation between language and cognition using developmental, cross-linguistic and multimodal approaches in the domains of mental state understanding and event cognition.
